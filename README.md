## **Search Algorithms in AI**

This repository focuses on implementing and exploring fundamental search algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence (AI). These algorithms are designed to solve a variety of search problems efficiently and are foundational to many AI systems. Inspired by the "Pacman AI" educational projects from UC Berkeley, this project offers a hands-on approach to learning and experimenting with AI search techniques.

## **Implemented Algorithms**
This project includes the implementation of the following search algorithms:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors of a node before moving deeper.
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Finds the least-cost path by exploring nodes in increasing cost order.
4. **A* Search:** Combines path cost and heuristic estimates to find optimal paths efficiently.

Each algorithm is applied to structured environments to demonstrate its strengths and limitations.

## **Project Objectives**
- **Educational Purpose:** This project is intended for learning and teaching AI concepts, particularly search techniques. It includes practical examples and problem-solving exercises to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
- **Customizable Testing:** Users can define their own search problems and test the algorithms under various scenarios.
- **Modular Design:** The project is structured to allow easy integration and extension for other AI-related projects.
